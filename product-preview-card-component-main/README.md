## My process

- Read ` style-guide.md` and set SCSS environment(variables, fonts, simple reset)
- Build the structure in `index.html` and put the image
- Set customized style
- Set response style
- Check whether everything meets expectations
- Edit `README.md` and push to GitHub

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Be clearer with <picture> tag:
  - <img> is necessary
  - The size of <source> will depend on <img> setting
  - <img> can't set `media` property,<source> can
  - If all pictures are the same type, `type` property can ignored.
